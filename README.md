# SQL-HandsOn
1.Retail-Mart-Management

Project Description:

As part of my learning journey, I successfully completed a retail data management project aimed at gaining hands-on experience in SQL and database management. The project involved designing and implementing a database named "SQL basics" for a hypothetical retail shop, Happy Mart. The objective was to store and analyze product details, customer information, and order data to gain insights into customer behavior and product stock details on a daily basis.

Tasks Completed:

Created a database named "SQL basics" to serve as the foundation for data storage and manipulation.

Selected the "SQL basics" database using SQL queries to facilitate subsequent operations.

Designed and implemented a "product" table with fields for product code, product name, price, stock, and category, allowing effective product data management.

Developed a "customer" table with fields for customer id, customer name, customer location, and customer phone number, enabling efficient customer information storage.

Set up a "sales" table with fields for date, order number, product code, product name, quantity, and price, providing a structured repository for order details.

Inserted sample data into the tables to populate the "SQL basics" database for testing and analysis.

Added two new columns, S_no and categories, to the "sales" table using SQL queries, enhancing the dataset with additional information for analysis purposes.

Changed the column type of the "stock" field in the "product" table to varchar, demonstrating flexibility in handling different data types.

Renamed the "customer" table to "customer details" using SQL queries for better clarity and improved understanding of the database structure.

Dropped the columns "S_no" and "categories" from the "sales" table to optimize the table design and improve data management efficiency.

Displayed specific fields, including order id, customer id, order date, price, and quantity, from the "sales" table using SQL queries for easy reference and analysis.

Extracted and displayed all details from the "product" table related to the stationary category using SQL queries to focus on specific product types.

Obtained a unique list of product categories from the "product" table using SQL queries to gain insights into the product range.

Displayed sales details where the quantity is greater than 2 and the price is less than 500 from the "sales" table using SQL queries to identify specific sales patterns.

Extracted and displayed customer names whose names end with the letter "a" using SQL queries to practice filtering and retrieving specific data.

Sorted and displayed product details in descending order of price using SQL queries to identify the most expensive products in the inventory.

Extracted and displayed product code and category details from similar categories with a quantity greater than or equal to 2 using SQL queries to identify popular product groups.

Combined the results of the "order" and "customer" tables, including duplicate rows, using SQL queries to practice data joining and improve data analysis capabilities.

This project provided invaluable practical experience in SQL and database management, empowering me to effectively store, retrieve, and analyze data for real-world scenarios in the field of data analytics.
